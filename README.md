WP Killswitch lets you non-destructively white out a difficult client's website while this plugin is active (recommended as an mu-plugin).

This is a git version of my plugin over at the Wordpress repository: [https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-killswitch/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-killswitch/)

## Description

WP Killswitch lets you non-destructively white out a difficult client's website while this plugin is active (recommended as an mu-plugin). It is suggested that this plugin should only be used as a last resort when negotiations with a particularly difficult client fail.

To stop the client disabling/deleting this plugin it is recommended you add this to the mu-plugins directory via FTP.

When activated this plugin will white out the front end of the website and make it inaccessible for visitors. The admin panel is still visible at your admin URL. This plugin will also display a warning notification in the admin telling the client/administrator to contact their webmaster.

Please remember to delete this plugin after you have successfully negotiated with the client.

If you are using this plugin for other purposes - to hide a website while you work on fixing something for example - please note that by initiating a white out on the front end of a website, you are not deleting or turning off the website. The contents of the site will still be visible to search engines and text only browsers. Any user can still see the content by viewing the source code of the page.
